    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nEcolabels signaling a sustainable or responsible production process have become an important product attribute for many food products, including seafood. If an ecolabel is to incentivize improved production practices, there must be a price premium associated with the label. Although price premiums for ecolabels in seafood markets have been studied in several European markets, evidence from the U.S. market is scarce, despite the importance of the U.S. in the global seafood market. In this study, we estimated the price premium for haddock labeled with the ecolabel of the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) in the U.S. We used the NielsenIQ Consumer Panel data from 2013-2020, together with UPC-codes obtained from the MSC on which products carried the ecolabel. Our results indicate that U.S. households, on average, pay a 17.23% premium for MSC-labeled haddock. This premium suggests that U.S. consumers place meaningful value on sustainability information and that market-based tools such as ecolabels may offer an effective mechanism to incentivize improvements in fisheries management and production practices."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Increasing productivity at the individual level is influenced by a complex mix of factors. While the literature generally suggests that green space exposure may enhance attention and well-being, urban environments are often perceived as less beneficial due to factors like noise and artificial design. This study investigates the effects of acute green and urban space exposure on productivity, aiming to fill a critical research gap in understanding how short-term environmental exposure impacts real-world performance. Using a lab-in-the-field experiment, we measured productivity through a math test and mental well-being via the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. A total of 222 participants completed both tests before and after a 20-minute treatment, involving a randomized walk in either a green or urban space, while a control group remained indoors. Significant treatment effects were observed within specific subgroups: infrequent green space visitors showed enhanced productivity after an urban walk, while frequent green space visitors experienced decreased productivity following a green space walk. Gender differences also emerged, with female participants reporting a boost in self-esteem after a walk in a green space, whereas both green and urban spaces led to declines in self-esteem for male participants. By addressing this research gap, our study challenges assumptions about the universal benefits of green space exposure and emphasizes the importance of tailoring environmental interventions. These insights offer valuable guidance for employers and urban planners in designing environments that enhance productivity and well-being across diverse populations."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Women’s participation in small-scale aquaculture is growing, but women producers remain in a disadvantaged position compared to men. Reducing gender gaps is at the core of many development programs, but little is known regarding the source of these differences. This paper investigates the main drivers of gender gaps in seaweed small-scale aquaculture by focusing on the analysis of differences between male and women, and across a series of psychological traits. We use data from a sample of 152 seaweed producers from central-southern Chile and perform a matching procedure to generate a balanced sample of male and female producers in the dimensions determining their performance in the sector. Our results show that female producers may exhibit more positive psychological traits such as patience and interpersonal trust. However, women’s choices in seaweed farming may be incongruent with these characteristics, as expecting more immediate returns than males, and may not be able to exploit the advantages of collaboration in selling in the sector. This supports the notion that opportunity costs (e.g., other activities in the marine area) and outside options (e.g., fishing versus trade) may be one of the major drivers of gender gaps and suggests that there are barriers keeping women from exploiting their potentially advantageous individual characteristics. Results provide important insights for the design of support instruments aimed at reducing these barriers faced by women in the sector"

    "section": "",
    "text": "While the rapid growth in global aquaculture production has made the industry a success story in terms of providing nutritious food, it is often criticized for its limited socioeconomic effects. While there is a burgeoning literature investigating socioeconomic impacts, this is a difficult topic due to limited data availability. In this paper, we will review the socioeconomic impacts of the Norwegian salmon aquaculture industry using economic impact analysis, focusing on two impact measures: employment and value added. In contrast to earlier studies, we will cover the whole supply chain from input suppliers to sales rather than focusing on one part of the chain and accounting for ripple effects in several rounds. This is highly important as there, in 2022, were 11,175 direct jobs in production, 8500 jobs in additional core activities related to processing and sales, and 38,000 jobs with different suppliers and service providers, for a total of 57,800 jobs in the industry. The production activities are highly dispersed geographically and mostly conducted in coastal communities. While this is also true for some types of services, the employment in the industry becomes more concentrated and moves toward larger communities and cities as one moves downstream or away from the core activities."

This is highly important as there, in 2022, were 11,175 direct jobs in production, 8500 jobs in additional core activities related to processing and sales, and 38,000 jobs with different suppliers and service providers, for a total of 57,800 jobs in the industry. The production activities are highly dispersed geographically and mostly conducted in coastal communities. While this is also true for some types of services, the employment in the industry becomes more concentrated and moves toward larger communities and cities as one moves downstream or away from the core activities."

    "text": "Global aquaculture production has been rapidly increasing in recent decades. Associated with this growth, there has been a discussion with respect to the industry’s socioeconomic impact. In particular, the industry’s ability to make a positive difference in the communities where it is conducted is often questioned. This is a difficult topic to address due to limited data availability. However, it is a critical question concerning the aquaculture industry’s long-term viability. Some recent studies have addressed specific indicators such as poverty reduction in a given country. However, no studies review the impact of an aquaculture industry on a broad set of indicators over time. In this paper, we review the impact of the Chilean salmon industry on three broad socioeconomic indicators: employment, salary level and migration; as well as several narrower indicators. While data beyond production initially are scarce and mostly found in the gray literature, the information they provide connects well with newer data sets as they become available. Not unexpectedly, employment in the Chilean aquaculture industry increases with production. The industry pays relatively well, and it has a societal impact as opportunities created by the industry first reverse outward migration and then lead to inward migration. This is also associated with reduced poverty, a more even income distribution, a higher female labor participation ratio, and higher education levels. While the overall socioeconomic impacts of the industry are positive, they are also disrupted by severe environmental crises and show that the socioeconomic benefits are conditioned on environmental sustainability."

We assess the Chilean case considering couples’ time allocation with an explicit consideration of intrahousehold bargaining power (relative wages and education). The Chilean case is interesting because we use the first urban national survey of time use, which could help understand gender differences in labor participation. We estimate a demand model, specifically a Multiple Discrete-Continuous Extreme Value (MDCEV) model considering six time-consuming activities on weekdays and weekends. In addition, we assess two hypothetical scenarios, namely, a proxy to childcare availability policy and an increase in women’s relative wages. We found that bargaining indicators are related to how individuals allocate their time, particularly the inverse relationship between the time allocated to housework and paid work. Moreover, we found that increasing women’s bargaining power in terms of wages could produce stronger labor force participation increments. Finally, our simulations show that while women can bridge the gap between paid and unpaid work, they continue to spend more time on domestic activities than men."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Environmental performance indicators are key to monitoring the sustainability of production processes. In the salmon industry, there is a growing concern about the excess of nutrients that have accumulated at the bottom of marine ecosystems and the negative externalities of those nutrients on the environment. In this paper, we measure environmental performance in the salmon industry in Chile by applying a set of data envelopment analysis (DEA) models. In these models, we incorporate pollutants as undesired outputs of the production process. Our data start in the years of the ISA virus outbreak and continue into the subsequent years of recovery in which stricter sanitary norms were implemented. All the models suggest a negative trend in both average technical and environmental efficiencies during the ISA virus outbreak and a subsequent increase in efficiency scores in the following years. A gap can be observed between environmental and technical efficiency measures, a gap that widened during the first years of the regulatory change and decreased at the end of the period. We argue that these findings offer preliminary evidence that environmental performance improved because of the new regulations."

    "title": "Impact assessment of salmon farming on income distribution in remote coastal areas: The Chilean case",
    "section": "",
    "text": "We analyzed the impact that the advent of the salmon aquaculture industry had on income distribution in coastal communities. Specifically, we evaluated whether salmon farms generated significant changes on household income distribution in the remote coastal areas of the Los Lagos region in Chile between 1992 and 2002. Salmon farms were expected to generate new labor and income opportunities for the local population. The impact on income distribution in the area should depend on which type of households were favored with this increased labor demand: low-income or high-income households. We tested this by applying impact evaluation techniques. Changes in income distribution were measured using Gini, Theil, and Mean Log Deviation (MLD) indices. We used information generated by small area estimation methods to measure individual household incomes. This latter was utilized to calculate the distribution indices at the locality level. We controlled for pre-existing differences and observable characteristics in the treatment group. Our results show that income inequality in areas with salmon farms fell significantly compared to areas without farms and this attenuated a general trend towards increasing inequality in the rural sector. These results are conditioned by the zone of influence of salmon farming, since the distance between the farm and the locality plays an important role in the impact on inequality. Finally, our results suggest that improvements in the position of households with medium incomes explain the reduction in income inequality."

    "title": "Labor outcomes effect of mental health",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nA chronic disease diagnosis is an event that can be a turning point in an individual’s lifestyle, affecting several behavioral dimensions, such as diet patterns (Edenbrandt et al., 2025; Hut & Oster, 2022), crime behavior (Andersen et al., 2025), prevalence of healthy behaviors, a change in alcohol use (Pinto & Trunzo, 2005), and labor market outcomes (Ramirez Lizardi et al., 2024). Mental health is a diagnosis that is particularly interesting from a behavioral perspective because it has multiple possible implications for the diagnosed individuals in terms of their economic, professional, and social life, as well as for health policy (Chisholm et al., 2016; Horwitz, 2011; Stecher et al., 2024). Globally, the most common mental disorders are anxiety and depression, and most people do not have access to effective care, even though effective prevention and treatment options exist. In 2016, it was estimated that 12 billion productive days were lost every year to depression and anxiety across 36 countries in the world, at a cost of nearly US$1 trillion, which included days lost to absenteeism, presenteeism, and staff turnover. Some of the social costs of depression are reduced educational attainment, lower wages, and costs to employers, as well as in labor force participation and productivity (Lerner & Henke, 2008). Individuals with a depression diagnosis can become an increasing cause of disability, suicides, and disease burden, and tend to coexist with other noncommunicable diseases (Hsieh & Qin, 2018). The relationship between mental health illness and labor outcomes is well documented in the literature; however, the causal effect of depression and anxiety on labor outcomes is less studied, despite the social consequences associated with those diseases. This relationship also faces some challenges because of the endogeneity problem of mental health diseases. The objective of this paper is to estimate how labor outcomes, specifically wages and employment, respond to a depression or anxiety diagnosis in households. We use a representative longitudinal panel data set from NielsenIQ Consumer Panel Data, complemented with the Annual Ailments, Health, and Wellness Survey. The Ailment data provides health information for a subset of panelists’ households from the consumer panel data. This allows us to track when households were diagnosed with depression or anxiety, while using the consumer panel allows us to extract demographic information from households. We employed a difference-in-differences design to estimate the effect of the diagnosis on labor outcomes. We find a statistically significant decrease in wages on average of 20% following a mental health diagnosis. This effect is small in the first years after the diagnosis, intensifying over time and being persistent for seven years. In addition to this, we show that the results are consistent across demographic heterogeneity, such as marital status (being stronger in divorced and single households), race, head of household age, household composition (stronger when living alone), and family type. We also find that the probability of being unemployed after the mental health diagnosis increases by 10%, but the effect is significant only after the fifth year of the diagnosis. This article makes several contributions. First, we expand the scarce evidence on the causal effects of health shocks on labor outcomes, providing evidence on how households present large and persistent declines in wages and increases in unemployment after a mental health diagnosis. The magnitude and long-run effects suggest that mental health conditions create substantial economic costs for households. Secondly, the heterogeneous impacts across demographic household attributes highlight that some population groups, particularly divorced, single, and single-person households, are more vulnerable to labor market disruptions following a mental health shock. Those results underscore the potential economic returns to early mental health detection, timely treatment, and workplace accommodations. Addressing mental health conditions nay not only improve individual well-being, but also mitigate long-term productivity in the labor market."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nNutritional information in food products has the potential to modify dietary choices. Such shifts in consumer behavior may help mitigate diet-related and non-communicable diseases, given the well-established link between poor diets and chronic disease morbidity and mortality. Labels that communicate health benefits can therefore serve as an important public-health tool by encouraging healthier choices and enabling consumers to make more informed decisions. Seafood, in particular, has garnered significant attention in nutritional research due to its role in preventing diet-related pathologies. A primary driver of these benefits is the presence of omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for brain development, metabolic regulation, and cardiovascular health. Despite these known benefits, approximately 90% of American households consume less than the recommended amounts of seafood. This study extends the literature by quantifying the hedonic price premium for the omega-3 label. The seafood examined includes the most consumed products in the U.S.: tuna, salmon, shrimp, cod, and oysters. We utilize the NielsenIQ consumer panel, which provides information about what products American households purchase, as well as the attributes of each of them. Ultimately, we find a positive and significant premium for tuna, salmon, and oysters. Our findings indicate that consumers place a measurable value on omega-3 information, as reflected in positive price premiums for several widely consumed seafood species. These results suggest that nutritional labeling can influence product valuation with implications for both market outcomes and dietary quality"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nDisease diagnosis can be a critical turning point in individuals’ lives and incentivize them to make lifestyle changes. However, the extent to which these events lead to significant changes in short- and long-term food choices and the extent to which this depends on demographics remain less studied. Seafood is a food group that is particularly interesting in this context. Despite well-documented health benefits, seafood consumption remains below recommended levels and vary significantly between demographic groups. Using a specific food group also allows the use of quantities in addition to expenditure or an index which may be important due to the closer relationship with nutrients, as well as exploring adjustments of the composition of products. Using the NielsenIQ datasets, this study examines how a type 2 diabetes diagnosis affected seafood purchasing behaviors in the United States, using a two-stage difference in difference approach. Our findings show a significant increase in seafood purchases post-diagnosis by 2%; the persistence of the impact vary about 8 years, before the effect eventually declines. There is heterogeneity in the results, showing that demographic differences in households play an important role in seafood purchases responses to a diagnosis, as well seafood species. Of particular interest is the fact that canned seafood was included in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children in the U.S. in 2024, increasing access to low income households that traditionally are among the groups that consumes least seafood. Our results indicate strong positive responses for canned seafood for low income households."
