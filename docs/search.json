    "title": "Sustainable seafood consumption: A hedonic analysis of eco-labeling in the U.S. market",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nEcolabels are an attribute that provides important information to consumers about the sustainability of the production process, contributing to reducing the information gap between consumers and producers. Although the price premiums for ecolabels in the seafood market are well-studied in Europe, this is not the case for the U.S. an important market in the global seafood markets, despite the concerns concerning environmental sustainability. In this article we explored the price premium for sustainable labeling in the seafood market in the United States, using the NielsenIQ Consumer Panel data from the 2010-2020 period, we extracted the price of the seafood products, as well as their attributes and we connected this dataset with the ecolabel of the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) obtained from the MSC. We worked with cod, haddock, and tuna data, and we tested the ecolabel variable using a hedonic prices approach and some spatial models. Our results show that households pay a premium for seafood with a sustainable label, as well as a number of attributes, such as brands and product form."

    "title": "The growing importance of aquaculture: The case of Norwegian salmon",
    "section": "",
    "text": "While the rapid growth in global aquaculture production has made the industry a success story in terms of providing nutritious food, it is often criticized for its limited socio-economic effects. While there is a burgeoning literature investigating socio-economic impacts, this is a difficult topic due to limited data availability. In this paper we will review the socio-economic impacts of the Norwegian salmon aquaculture industry using economic impact analysis focusing on two impact measures, employment and value added. In contrast to earlier studies, we will cover the whole supply chain from input suppliers to sales rather than focusing on one part of the chain, and accounting for ripple effects in several rounds. This is highly important as there in 2022 were around 11,600 direct jobs in production, 8,000 jobs in additional core activities related to processing and sales and 33,000 jobs with different suppliers and service providers, for a total of 52,600 jobs in the industry. The production activities are highly dispersed geographically and mostly conducted in coastal communities. While this is also true for some types of services, the employment in the industry becomes more concentrated and moves towards larger communities and cities as one move down-stream or away from the core activities."

    "text": "Women’s participation in small-scale aquaculture is growing, but women producers remain in a disadvantaged position compared to men. Reducing gender gaps is at the core of many development programs, but little is known regarding the source of these differences. This paper investigates the main drivers of gender gaps in seaweed small-scale aquaculture by focusing on the analysis of differences between male and women, and across a series of psychological traits. We use data from a sample of 152 seaweed producers from central-southern Chile and perform a matching procedure to generate a balanced sample of male and female producers in the dimensions determining their performance in the sector. Our results show that female producers may exhibit more positive psychological traits such as patience and interpersonal trust. However, women’s choices in seaweed farming may be incongruent with these characteristics, as expecting more immediate returns than males, and may not be able to exploit the advantages of collaboration in selling in the sector. This supports the notion that opportunity costs (e.g., other activities in the marine area) and outside options (e.g., fishing versus trade) may be one of the major drivers of gender gaps and suggests that there are barriers keeping women from exploiting their potentially advantageous individual characteristics. Results provide important insights for the design of support instruments aimed at reducing these barriers faced by women in the sector"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Environmental performance indicators are key to monitoring the sustainability of production processes. In the salmon industry, there is a growing concern about the excess of nutrients that have accumulated at the bottom of marine ecosystems and the negative externalities of those nutrients on the environment. In this paper, we measure environmental performance in the salmon industry in Chile by applying a set of data envelopment analysis (DEA) models. In these models, we incorporate pollutants as undesired outputs of the production process. Our data start in the years of the ISA virus outbreak and continue into the subsequent years of recovery in which stricter sanitary norms were implemented. All the models suggest a negative trend in both average technical and environmental efficiencies during the ISA virus outbreak and a subsequent increase in efficiency scores in the following years. A gap can be observed between environmental and technical efficiency measures, a gap that widened during the first years of the regulatory change and decreased at the end of the period. We argue that these findings offer preliminary evidence that environmental performance improved because of the new regulations."

    "section": "",
    "text": "During the last decades, important policies have been implemented to incorporate women into the labor market, reduce persistent gender inequalities, and balance the time allocation between paid and unpaid work. We assess the Chilean case considering couples’ time allocation with an explicit consideration of intrahousehold bargaining power (relative wages and education). The Chilean case is interesting because we use the first urban national survey of time use, which could help understand gender differences in labor participation. We estimate a demand model, specifically a Multiple Discrete-Continuous Extreme Value (MDCEV) model considering six time-consuming activities on weekdays and weekends. In addition, we assess two hypothetical scenarios, namely, a proxy to childcare availability policy and an increase in women’s relative wages. We found that bargaining indicators are related to how individuals allocate their time, particularly the inverse relationship between the time allocated to housework and paid work. Moreover, we found that increasing women’s bargaining power in terms of wages could produce stronger labor force participation increments. Finally, our simulations show that while women can bridge the gap between paid and unpaid work, they continue to spend more time on domestic activities than men."

    "text": "During the last decades, important policies have been implemented to incorporate women into the labor market, reduce persistent gender inequalities, and balance the time allocation between paid and unpaid work. We assess the Chilean case considering couples’ time allocation with an explicit consideration of intrahousehold bargaining power (relative wages and education). The Chilean case is interesting because we use the first urban national survey of time use, which could help understand gender differences in labor participation. We estimate a demand model, specifically a Multiple Discrete-Continuous Extreme Value (MDCEV) model considering six time-consuming activities on weekdays and weekends. In addition, we assess two hypothetical scenarios, namely, a proxy to childcare availability policy and an increase in women’s relative wages. We found that bargaining indicators are related to how individuals allocate their time, particularly the inverse relationship between the time allocated to housework and paid work. Moreover, we found that increasing women’s bargaining power in terms of wages could produce stronger labor force participation increments. Finally, our simulations show that while women can bridge the gap between paid and unpaid work, they continue to spend more time on domestic activities than men."

    "title": "Salmon Aquaculture in Chile: Production Growth and Socioeconomic Impacts",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Global aquaculture production has been rapidly increasing in recent decades. Associated with this growth, there has been a discussion with respect to the industry’s socioeconomic impact. In particular, the industry’s ability to make a positive difference in the communities where it is conducted is often questioned. This is a difficult topic to address due to limited data availability. However, it is a critical question concerning the aquaculture industry’s long-term viability. Some recent studies have addressed specific indicators such as poverty reduction in a given country. However, no studies review the impact of an aquaculture industry on a broad set of indicators over time. In this paper, we review the impact of the Chilean salmon industry on three broad socioeconomic indicators: employment, salary level and migration; as well as several narrower indicators. While data beyond production initially are scarce and mostly found in the gray literature, the information they provide connects well with newer data sets as they become available. Not unexpectedly, employment in the Chilean aquaculture industry increases with production. The industry pays relatively well, and it has a societal impact as opportunities created by the industry first reverse outward migration and then lead to inward migration. This is also associated with reduced poverty, a more even income distribution, a higher female labor participation ratio, and higher education levels. While the overall socioeconomic impacts of the industry are positive, they are also disrupted by severe environmental crises and show that the socioeconomic benefits are conditioned on environmental sustainability."

    "title": "Impact assessment of salmon farming on income distribution in remote coastal areas: The Chilean case",
    "section": "",
    "text": "We analyzed the impact that the advent of the salmon aquaculture industry had on income distribution in coastal communities. Specifically, we evaluated whether salmon farms generated significant changes on household income distribution in the remote coastal areas of the Los Lagos region in Chile between 1992 and 2002. Salmon farms were expected to generate new labor and income opportunities for the local population. The impact on income distribution in the area should depend on which type of households were favored with this increased labor demand: low-income or high-income households. We tested this by applying impact evaluation techniques. Changes in income distribution were measured using Gini, Theil, and Mean Log Deviation (MLD) indices. We used information generated by small area estimation methods to measure individual household incomes. This latter was utilized to calculate the distribution indices at the locality level. We controlled for pre-existing differences and observable characteristics in the treatment group. Our results show that income inequality in areas with salmon farms fell significantly compared to areas without farms and this attenuated a general trend towards increasing inequality in the rural sector. These results are conditioned by the zone of influence of salmon farming, since the distance between the farm and the locality plays an important role in the impact on inequality. Finally, our results suggest that improvements in the position of households with medium incomes explain the reduction in income inequality."

    "text": "Risk is an inherent characteristic of aquaculture production. For a holistic understanding of risk, the risk assessment process must account for both subjective and objective dimensions of risk. This paper empirically studies the role of risk perception and the risk properties of inputs used in aquaculture to explain the low adoption rates of seaweed farming in Chile. We propose a risk production estimation framework with selectivity to explore the role of risk, given that many aquaculture concessions remain totally or partially unexploited. We found that farmers are more likely to produce seaweed when they perceive greater access to financing, but also that this activity is more exposed to theft than other activities. Moreover, results suggest that labor and energy are risk-increasing inputs, while we found that capital and the number of hectares available are risk-decreasing inputs. The latter is important as it suggests that larger seaweed producers and more investment would reduce production variability"

    "text": "Increasing productivity at the individual level is influenced by a complex mix of factors. While the literature generally suggests that green space exposure may enhance attention and well-being, urban environments are often perceived as less beneficial due to factors like noise and artificial design. This study investigates the effects of acute green and urban space exposure on productivity, aiming to fill a critical research gap in understanding how short-term environmental exposure impacts real-world performance. Using a lab-in-the-field experiment, we measured productivity through a math test and mental well-being via the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. A total of 222 participants completed both tests before and after a 20-minute treatment, involving a randomized walk in either a green or urban space, while a control group remained indoors. Significant treatment effects were observed within specific subgroups: infrequent green space visitors showed enhanced productivity after an urban walk, while frequent green space visitors experienced decreased productivity following a green space walk. Gender differences also emerged, with female participants reporting a boost in self-esteem after a walk in a green space, whereas both green and urban spaces led to declines in self-esteem for male participants. By addressing this research gap, our study challenges assumptions about the universal benefits of green space exposure and emphasizes the importance of tailoring environmental interventions. These insights offer valuable guidance for employers and urban planners in designing environments that enhance productivity and well-being across diverse populations."
