# Abstract 

Ecolabels signaling a sustainable or responsible production process have become an important product attribute for many food products including seafood. If an ecolabel is to incentivize improved production practises, there must be a price premium associated with the label. Although price premiums for ecolabels in seafood markets have been been studied in several European markets, evidence from the U.S. market is scarce, despite the importance of US in the global seafood market. In this study, we estimated the price premium for haddock labeled with the ecolabel of the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) in the U.S. We used the NielsenIQ Consumer Panel data from the 2013-2020, and connected this dataset with the MSC-ecolabel using UPC-codes obtained from the MSC. The premium of the MSC-ecolabel as well as other product attributes are estimated using a hedonic price model. Our results indicate that U.S. households on average pay a 22% premium for MSC-labeled haddock. However, only high- and low-income households are found to pay a premium, while the attribute is insignificant for middle-income households.
