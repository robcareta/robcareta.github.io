## Abstract

Increasing productivity at the individual level has proven to be a complex equation of numerous factors. The literature has provided evidence that targeted green space exposure can lend to increased attention and overall well-being improvements. On the other hand, urban settings do not provide the mind with a restful environment due to the noise, color palettes, and unnatural shapes of buildings. In this study, we examine the effects of acute green space exposure on productivity and well-being using a framed field experiment, measured by a math and a Rosenberg test, respectively. In total, 222 adult participants performed both tests before and after between-subjects treatments implemented at the session level. The two treatments consist of a 20-minute walk randomized at either a green or an urban space, while the control group spends 20 minutes inside the experiment building. We estimate the average treatment effect which shows neither of the treatments resulted in a statistically significant difference from the control group regarding participants' productivity and well-being. This is an important null result that warrants further investigation.
