# Abstract 

Disease diagnosis can be a critical turning point in individuals’ lives and incentivize them to make lifestyle changes.
However, the extent to which these events lead to significant changes in short- and long-term food choices and the
extent to which this depends on diagnosis and demographics remain less studied. Seafood is a food group that is
particularly interesting in this context. Despite well-documented health benefits, seafood consumption remains below
recommended levels and vary significantly between demographic groups. Using the NielsenIQ datasets, this
study examines how three diet-related disease diagnoses, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, and heart disease, affected
seafood purchasing behaviors in the United States, using a two-stage difference in difference approach. Our
findings show a significant increase in seafood purchases post-diagnosis by 5%–8% for all diagnosis; the persistence
of the impact vary between 5 and 12 years depending on the diagnosis, before the effect eventually declines. There is
heterogeneity in the results, showing that demographic differences in households play an important role in seafood
purchases responses to a diagnosis. In particular, although the wealthier and more educated always increase their
purchases, the poorest groups increase in a higher proportion when they are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes but do
not respond to a diagnosis related to heart disease
